"""Post-installation script for Playwright.

This script is executed after the dependencies are installed on Streamlit Cloud.
It ensures that the Chromium browser used by Playwright is downloaded into
a local directory under the project root rather than the default global
location. Storing the browser in the repository folder avoids issues with
readâ€‘only filesystems in the cloud environment.

The environment variable `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is set to `./ms-playwright`
by Streamlit Cloud during deployment. When this variable is defined Playwright
will download its browser bundles into the specified directory instead of
`~/.cache/playwright`.
