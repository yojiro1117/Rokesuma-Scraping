"""Post installation script to fetch Playwright browser binaries.

Running this script will download the Chromium browser required by
Playwright into the local project directory.  It honours the
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH environment variable which is set to
`./ms-playwright` by default in run scripts.  Without running this
installation step the scraper will fail to launch a browser.

Usage
-----
    python postinstall_playwright.py

If the download fails due to network issues, re-run the script once
connectivity has been restored.  The script is idempotent: if the
browsers are already present no action is taken.
